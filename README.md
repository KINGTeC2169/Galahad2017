# Galahad2017
KING TeC's Rebound Rumble Robot "Galahad", reprogrammed with Royal-Iterative and modern hardware.

An example of how to use the Royal-Iterative Library for FRC, using PIDs on Talons, and organizing a codebase to allow for modular design, rapid repairs/changes, and high levels of closed-loop control of the entire system.

Note: This code was written in the off-season as a learning project, and does not contain any autonomous software and was never used in any offical FIRST competitions.
