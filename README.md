# Galihad2017
Newly Programmed Galihad Software for RIO and Talons.

An example of how to do WPILib Iterative Programming, PIDs on Talons, and maybe in the future Pathfinder for Tank Drive.

Note: This code was written in the off-season as a learning project, and does not contain any autonomous software and was never used in any offical FIRST competitions.
